<h2>Bit About Me</h2>

<p> I'm currently a master's student of Statistics and Applied Probability at the University of California Santa Barbara (Graduating Spring '22). I lean towards applied statistics and data science, but have done some more theoretical coursework as well. I like working with environmental, ecological, and economic data. Prior to graduate school, I worked for four years as an analyst in private sector antritrust economics. My primary undergraduate degree from the University of Virginia (BS, '16) is in <a href = "https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/engineering-systems-and-environment/systems-engineering">Systems Engineering</a>. I also earned a second undergraduate degree in Economics (BA, '16).</p>


<h2>Projects</h2>

 <ul>
  <!-- Renewable Energy Prediction Project -->
  <li><a href="https://leoncw.github.io/PSTAT231_Final/Final_Project_html_Broderick_Weinberg.html" target="_blank">Predicting Countries' Renewable Energy Percentage with Environmental Indicators</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a series of environmental indicator variables, can we predict the proportion of a country's electricity generation that came from renewable sources in 2017? This project focuses on exploring various statistical learning methods for predicting a continuous response, with an emphasis on sparse methods and implementing cross-validation minimize prediction error.</li>
      <li>Completed as part of PSTAT 231 course credit at UCSB. Two person project with Hailey Broderick, the project was completed via Github <a href="https://github.com/leoncw/PSTAT231_Final" target="_blank">(Direct link to Project Github Page)</a>.</li>

  <!-- Covid 19 Vaccination California Project -->
  <li><a href="https://leoncw.github.io/California-Covid-19-Vaccine-Analysis/220C_Final_Project%20Callum%20Weinberg.pdf" target="_blank">An Inferential Analysis of California's Covid 19 Vaccine Uptake, One Month After Open Access</a>
    <ul>
      <li>In the spring of 2021, there was a number of studies analyzing vaccine uptake and demographics at the country and state level, but less so at more granular geographic areas. This report performs an inferential analysis of vaccine uptake in California a month after open access, with observations being tabulated at the Zip Code Tabulation Area geographic level. A count regression approach (Poisson regression) is used to model vaccine uptake with demographic variables as covariates. </li>
