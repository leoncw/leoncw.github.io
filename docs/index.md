<h2>Bit About Me</h2>

<p> I'm currently a master's student of Statistics and Applied Probability at the University of California Santa Barbara (Graduating Spring '22). I lean towards applied statistics and data science, but have done some more theoretical coursework as well. I like working with environmental, ecological, and economic data. Prior to graduate school, I worked for four years as an analyst in private sector antritrust economics. My primary undergraduate degree from the University of Virginia (BS, '16) is in <a href = "https://engineering.virginia.edu/departments/engineering-systems-and-environment/systems-engineering">Systems Engineering</a>. I also earned a second undergraduate degree in Economics (BA, '16).</p>


<h2>Projects</h2>

 <ul>
  <li><p><a href="https://leoncw.github.io/PSTAT231_Final/Final_Project_html_Broderick_Weinberg.html">Predicting Countries' Renewable Energy Percentage with Environmental Indicators</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Using a series of environmental indicator variables, can we predict the proportion of a country's electricity generation that came from renewable sources in 2017? This project focuses on exploring various statistical learning methods for predicting a continuous response, with an emphasis on sparse methods and implementing cross-validation minimize prediction error.</li>
      <li>Completed as part of PSTAT 231 course credit at UCSB. Two person project with Hailey Broderick, the project was completed via Github <a href="https://github.com/leoncw/PSTAT231_Final">(Direct link to Project Github Page)</a>.</li>
